Touch it. Go on. Caress \nthe fabric.”\nDany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like \nwater. She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. “Is it really mine?”\n“A gift from the Magister Illyrio,” Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood \ntonight. “The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.”\nA princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never \nreally known. “Why does he give us so much?” she asked. “What does he want from us?” For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister’s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos.\n“Illyrio is no fool,” Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a \nfeverish look in his pale lilac eyes. “The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.”\nDany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and \nother, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he’d never had a friend he wouldn’t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible thing when roused. Viserys called it “waking the dragon.”\nHer brother hung the gown beside the door. “Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be \nsure you wash off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount.” He studied her critically. “You still slouch. Straighten yourself” He pushed back her shoulders with his hands. “Let them see that you have a woman’s shape now.” His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. “You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. \n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# download from wiki","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!  pip install
