Excited 😄 to share with you my very first model 🤖 for generating question-answering datasets! This incredible model takes articles 📜 or web pages, and all you need to provide is a prompt and context. It works like magic ✨, generating both the question and the answer. The prompt can be anything – "what," "who," "where" ... etc ! 😅

I've harnessed the power of the flan-t5 model 🚀, which has truly elevated the quality of the results. You can find all the code and details in the repository right here: https://lnkd.in/dhE5s_qg

And guess what? I've even deployed the project, so you can experience the magic firsthand: https://lnkd.in/diq-d3bt ❤️

Join me on this exciting journey into #nlp, #textgeneration, #t5, #deeplearning, and #huggingface. Your feedback and collaboration are more than welcome! 🌟
